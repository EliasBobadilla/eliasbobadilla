                        I'm a young professional with more than 10 years of experience in software development and
                        document management solutions. I think about myself as a self-learner by nature, exited at
                        process improvement, curious and appasionate about technology, also I could self describe me in
                        both personally and professional life, as responsible, with solid values, high analytical skills
                        and strategic thinking.
