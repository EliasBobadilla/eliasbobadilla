        <span class="about-me">
            I'm a young professional with more than 10 years of experience in software development and
            document management solutions. I think about myself as a self-learner by nature, exited at
            process improvement, curious and appasionate about technology, also I could self describe me in
            both personally and professional life, as responsible, with solid values, high analytical skills
            and strategic thinking.
